# @exercism/eslint-config-tooling

This is the shared [`eslint`][web-eslint] configuration used by various pieces of tooling, such as the [JavaScript Analyzer][git-javascript-analyzer], [Representer][git-javascript-representer], and [Test Runner][git-javascript-test-runner].
The same configuration is used for the TypeScript tooling as well as various other pieces of technology.
[Shareable configs][web-shareable-configs] are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files.
This means you can use the same configuration [Exercism][web-exercism] uses in your own projects!

## Usage

To use the configuration for students, open your [eslint configuration][web-eslint-configuration] file, and add the following value to `extends`. For example, for JSON based configuration files:

```json
{
  "extends": "@exercism/eslint-config-tooling"
}
```

## Configuration

Find the configuration [here](index.js).
It's goal is to help detect and prevent common problems, and enforce a consistent code style.

The rules are based on:

- [`eslint:recommended`][web-eslint-recommended]
- [`plugin:import`][git-eslint-plugin-import]
- A few extra rules that catch common issues but are not enabled via the recommended plugin.

It also includes the [`prettier` plugin][git-eslint-plugin-prettier] because we use [`prettier`][web-prettier] to achieve consistent code formatting.
This plugin turns _off_ rules that conflict with formatting.

Because most of the tooling is primarily focussing on running on Node, only `node` and `es2021` are turned on as environment, but when extending this configuration, you can add more (or turn those off).

## Type-based rules

In order to be able to use type information in the eslint rules, the appropiate parser option must be set.

```json
{
  "parserOptions": {
    "tsconfigRootDir": __dirname,
    "project": ["./tsconfig.json"]
  }
}
```

`"tsconfigRootDir": __dirname,` is not required, but allows your editor to not infer this value, which it almost always does incorrectly, especially when you *do not* open the repository at git root / location of the `.eslint` configuration file. Setting the `tsconfigRootDir` forces the root directory for `eslint` to be the value given, and stop the editor and editor plugins from inferring the value. Setting it to a value of `__dirname` is only available in JavaScript based configuration files.

## Setup with multiple tsconfig.json and ts-paths

When working with multiple folders and a composite `tsconfig.json` structure and/or using the `compilerOptions` with `paths`, you might have difficulty resolving issues around it not being able to find files, definitions, and more.
A common problem is `eslint` complaining about files not being present or included in the configuration.
Another common problem is types reporting as `any` to `eslint`, even when they do resolve inside the editor.

An easy way to resolve this is to create a new `tsconfig.eslint.json` that includes all the files in the project, including the test files.
That `tsconfig.eslint.json` should then be referred in `project`, instead of the regular configuration file.
You can check out the [JavaScript Analyzer][git-javascript-analyzer] for an example.
